# Last Year

- Used linear and multiple regression to predict housing prices in Seattle
- Used logistic regression and k-nearest neighbours classification algorithms to predict the quality of wines based on their attributes
- Built a webapp that used a pre-trained model to suggest how much a house should cost based on its features
- Had some food üçù
